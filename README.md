## WHO AM I?
I am currently a final-year student in Software and Data Engineering at ENSA Khouribga. As part of my academic program, I am seeking a final internship (PFE) in the field of data analytics and business intelligence (BI). I am passionate about exploring data and using analytical tools to generate valuable insights
## [Business Steering Model Outputs Modeling and Visualization](https://github.com/nissrine41/Business-Steering-Model-Optimization-and-Visualization--GROUPE-OCP)


**Description:**  
During my internship at GROUPE OCP, I focused on modeling and visualizing the outputs of the Business Steering model. This project involved optimizing the sales and production planning processes by creating dynamic dashboards.

**Tools and Technologies Used:**
- **Excel:** For data manipulation and initial analysis.
- **Pandas:** To handle data frames and perform data analysis in Python.
- **OpenPyXL:** For reading and writing Excel files programmatically.
- **Power BI:** For creating interactive visualizations and dashboards.
- **Power Query:** To transform and prepare data for analysis.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** For calculations and data modeling in Power BI.

**Key Contributions:**
- Developed interactive dashboards to enhance decision-making capabilities and improve efficiency in sales and production planning.

**Project 2:** [AliExpress Product Analysis](https://github.com/nissrine41/AliExpress-Product-Insights-An-Analytical-Dashboard)

**Description:**  
This project involves analyzing products from AliExpress to derive insights that can assist in decision-making and marketing strategies. The analysis focuses on product performance, pricing strategies, and customer preferences. I utilized my own scraped data from AliExpress, ensuring a comprehensive dataset for analysis.

**Tools and Technologies Used:**
- **Selenium:** For web scraping to collect product data from AliExpress.
- **WebDriver:** To automate the browsing process and extract necessary product information.
- **Python:** For data manipulation and initial analysis.
- **Pandas:** For handling data frames and performing data analysis.
- **Power BI:** For creating interactive visualizations and dashboards.
- **Power Query:** To transform and prepare data for analysis in Power BI.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** For calculations and data modeling in Power BI.

**Key Contributions:**
- Scraped product data from AliExpress using Selenium and WebDriver, allowing for a rich dataset.
- Developed interactive dashboards in Power BI to enhance decision-making capabilities.
- Analyzed sales performance to identify high-demand products and trends.
- Recommended pricing strategies based on competitive analysis of product categories and brands.
- Created visualizations to effectively communicate findings and support data-driven decision-making.

  **Project 3:** [Earthquake Dashboard](https://github.com/nissrine41/earthquake-2023-Dashboard)

**Description:**  
This project involves the creation of an Earthquake Dashboard that visualizes earthquake events data. The dashboard provides insights into the characteristics of seismic events using a star schema design for data modeling.

**Tools and Technologies Used:**
- **Talend:** For data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) to create the star schema.
- **Power BI:** For visualizing the earthquake data through interactive dashboards.

**Key Contributions:**
- Designed a star schema for organizing earthquake data, enabling efficient querying and analysis.
- Developed interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualize key metrics related to seismic events.
- Analyzed earthquake trends and patterns to provide insights into seismic activity in different regions.
